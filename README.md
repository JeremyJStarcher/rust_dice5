# rust_Dice5

Dice5 is a clone of the popular Yahtzee&trade; game.

```
rustc --version
rustc 1.32.0 (9fda7c223 2019-01-16)
```

## About
This version _mostly_ follows the 1967 rules.

The game is fully playable through the command line and is builds cleanly
under both Windows and Unix systems.  Untested on Mac, but I have no
doubt that it will work on there as well.

## Why?

This game was written as an exercise to learn Rust.
